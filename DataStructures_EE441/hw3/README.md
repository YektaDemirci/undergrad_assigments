# Explanation
## Introduction
Implement a simple OS process scheduler using Linked list and Binary Search Tree.
## Notes
I have only implemented Linked List version.\
It is marked as 55/55.\
Assigment requiremeents can be seen in EE441_HW3.pdf
## Notes to the TAs
Performance values of the linked lists are slightly better than the TA solutions. Even I am surprised :P\   
Binary Search Tree is not implemented.\
