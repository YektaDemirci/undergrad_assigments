## Introduction
4th year elective Introduction to Machine Learning course, offered by Computer Engineering, METU. \
Lectures are given by Professor Seyda Ertekin. \
I started learning Python with this couse and I took it as extra. It was challanging to compete with computer engineering students with EE background. However, it was a great experience.
