# Explanation
## Introduction
4th year elective lab course where Digital Signal Processing techniques firstly implemented on MATLAB then on myRIO embedded device.
Lectures were given by Professor Temel Engin Tuncer.
Labs were guided by TA Aybuke Erol.
## Notes

Implemented MATLAB and LabVIEW codes were not permitted to be uploaded anywhere. However the reports can are uploaded.
Almost all of the reports are graded as +90/100.
Reports may have typos and grammar mistakes since the labs had very harsh time constraints. 
Implemented codes in MATLAB and C for the project are uploaded.
